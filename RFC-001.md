# RFC-001: Tactical Spike (Tracer Bullet)

## Summary
This repository implements the minimum viable tracer bullet for Laminar: CSV -> parse -> validate -> intent -> output. The goal is to prove zatoshi precision and dual-mode output.

## In Scope
- CLI that reads CSV with header
- Parsing decimal ZEC amounts into u64 zatoshis
- Fail-fast validation with full error reporting
- Human/agent output split via TTY detection
- Deterministic agent JSON output

## Out of Scope (for this repo)
- ZIP-321 URIs
- UR/QR encoding
- Desktop app integration
- Wallet signing or broadcast

## Current Status
- Implemented and tested locally
- Deterministic output verified
- Demo scripts provided in `demo/`
